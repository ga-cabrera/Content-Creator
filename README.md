# Project1
a branch off of gerson cabrera's project1 for UW coding bootcamp
## Overview
Have you ever seen those pesky images or gifs on your social media that try to make you smile? Have they failed? Do you think you can do better? Welcome to our image file generator (name in the making). Add any phrase, quote, pretty much any text  to any gif or photo you want, and share it with the social-media world. Want to risk it all to chance? Use our randomizer and we’ll add a random phrase or quote to a random gif or photo and see if it makes your day. 

## Primary Goals
Add text to an image file, and create a new image file.
Share new image file with a social media platform or one’s choosing (facebook, twitter, reddit, etc.)
## Specifications
We plan on using social media api’s to share image file and we want to use the giphy api or other (or multiple) to grab our image file from. This isn’t a new concept, but we do plan on making our website easy to use and attractive enough so that it brings in online traffic (in theory). 

## Target Audience
Mainly pre-teens and Young adults 
## Problem & how to address it 
Allows users to create their own content easily and quickly without having to pay for photo editing software or dealing with editing apps.

## Use Case
a user visits the website to create an image file:
- user searches for a term they're interested in
- user then selects an image and a quote they want to combine to create one image
- there's also an option to choose a random topic without searching for your own topic
- once the image file is created, it will get it's own url that will be used with the social media pugins
- user will post their image file to their facebook or twitter!

Overview
Have you ever seen those pesky images or gifs on your social media that try to make you smile? Have they failed? Do you think you can do better? Welcome to our meme generator (name in the making). Add any phrase, quote, pretty much any text  to any gif or photo you want, and share it with the social-media world. Want to risk it all to chance? Use our randomizer and we’ll add a random phrase or quote to a random gif or photo and see if it makes your day. 
Primary Goals
Add text to an image file, and create a new image file.
